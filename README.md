### **Instructions:**  
1. Start `usb_flash_drive_connection_check`.  
2. Connect the specific USB flash drive you want to use as the encryption key to your computer.  
3. A new folder named **"Secure Data"** will be created inside the project's directory.  
4. When the USB flash drive is disconnected, all file contents will be encrypted using AES.  
5. The files will remain encrypted until the same USB flash drive is reconnected.

### **About the Project:**  
I created this project while learning about cryptography and wanted to try implementing AES encryption in a practical way. It was a fun challenge, and I built it as a learning experience rather than a professional security solution.
